update-publications is a source that operates in two steps.  It first queries
the ObjectStore to find the pubmed identifiers of all Publications.  It then
queries the NCBI pubmed server to find the full title and author list, then
updates the Publication objects with that information.  All sources use pubmed
ID to identify publications.
