    <intro-text>
      As a term meaning "a body of persons sharing a culture," people is a singular
      noun, as in As a people the Pueblo were noteworthy for their peacefulness.
      Its plural is peoples: the many and varied peoples of West Africa. But when used
      to mean "humans," people is plural and has no corresponding singular form.
      English is not unique in this respect; Spanish, Italian, Russian, and many
      other languages have a plural word meaning "people" that has no singular.

    <intro-text>
      An entity is something that has a distinct, separate existence, though it
      need not be a material existence. In particular, abstractions and legal
      fictions are usually regarded as entities. In general, there is also no
      presumption that an entity is animate.

      An entity could be viewed as a set containing subsets. This set itself is among
      other sets. In philosophy, these sets are said to be abstract objects as they do 
      not refer to anything animate. The distinctive propriety of an entity rationally
      yields the existence of the relatively distinct entities.
