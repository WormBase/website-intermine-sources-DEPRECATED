  <para>InterMine is an general-purpose object-oriented data warehouse system
  developed as part of the <ulink url="http://www.flymine.org">FlyMine</ulink>
  project and made available as stand-alone open-source software.  It is able
  to create a query-optimised data warehouse with a powerful web interface
  for any data model.</para>

  <para>InterMine.bio is an extension to InterMine that defines a biological
  data model (based on the <ulink url="http://song.sourceforge.net/">Sequence
  Ontology</ulink>) and is able to integrate data from many standard formats
  and databases used in biology.  Instances of InterMine.bio are created
  by specifying the sources to load and configuring the particular organisms
  and data files required.  A framework is provided for adding new sources to
  load custom data, each new source can easily extend the data model.</para>

  <para>InterMine.bio was developed to create <ulink url="http://www.flymine.org">
  FlyMine</ulink> and is now being used in other projects.  Updated documentation
  is available at <ulink url="http://trac.flymine.org">trac.flymine.org</ulink>.  This
  includes a tutorial for creating <ulink url="http://www.flymine.org/malaria">MalariaMine</ulink>, a demostration of setting up InterMine.bio with a minimal set of
  malaria data.  See an example runnning at <ulink url="http://www.flymine.org/malaria">
