<div class="heading2">modMine version 1 - release notes (28th January 2008)</div>
<div class="body">
<p style="font-size: +1.1em;">
Release 1 of modMine includes data from FlyBase and WormBase, GO annotation, Uniprot, orthologue and paralogue information from InParanoid, public literature references.</p>
</div>
<!--
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>
The <i>D. melanogaster</i> genome has been updated to release 5.4 from FlyBase.  We have added a new microarray-based gene expression data set for the life cycle of <i>A. gambiae</i>.  'Life cycle transcriptome of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae and comparison with the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster.' (Koutsos et al 2007 - <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=%2017563388">PubMed</a>).  
</p>
<p>
Other data changes:
<ul>
  <li>FIX - duplicate introns have been removed for <i>D. melanogaster</i> and <i>D. pseudoobscura</i>, modMine used to infer introns but they are now imported from FlyBase.</li>
  <li>FIX - introns are now created on the correct strand for <i>A. gambiae</i> and <i>A. mellifera</i>.</li>
  <li>FIX - orthologues for <i>A. gambiae</i>, <i>A. mellifera</i> and <i>A. aegypti</i> now reference genes as well as translations, they will now appear in results of more template queries.</li>
  <li>FIX - <i>D. pseudoobscura</i> 'Unknown' assembly groups are no longer created as chromosomes.</li>
  <li>FIX - the 'localised' category has been removed for fly-FISH expression data, the data now just shows whether a gene is expressed or not at a particular stage.</li>
</ul> 
</p>
<h3>List Conversion</h3>
<p>The List analysis page has a new 'Convert' section for instant conversion between common types (genes, proteins, transcripts amd exons).  Counts of each type are displayed for a list - e.g. the numbers of proteins, transcripts and exons found for a list of genes.  Clicking on the type will bring up a results table from which you can export identifiers, sequence or create a new list.
</p>

<h3>External links</h3>
<p>We have added links to more external databases from report pages - e.g. to model organism databases and REDfly.  We now have a simple configuration system for links so if you have suggestions of other databases it would by useful to link to please let us know - support[at]flymine.org.
</p>

<h3>Tutorial and FAQ</h3>
<p>We have added a tutorial on creating and using lists in modMine, see the <a href="/help.shtml">help page</a>.  There is also a list of <a href="http://www.intermine.org/wiki/modMineFAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</a> linked to from the header.
</p>

<h3>User interface changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>NEW - the queries run when clicking on graphs or tables in list analysis widgets now include more information.</li>
  <li>NEW - number of rows shown in results tables is remembered.</li>
  <li>FIX - performance improvement for uploading lists with more than 1000 elements.</li>
  <li>FIX - fixed problem where user was logged out or history was lost when returning to the home page.</li>
  <li>FIX - uploading a list from a file is fixed on Safari.</li>
  <li>FIX - it is now more obvious when long text entries have been truncated in results tables.</li>
  <li>FIX - fixed 'div has no properties' error in templates tab if user created two templates with the same title.</li>
</ul>

<div class="heading2">modMine version 9.0 - release notes (8th November 2007)</div>
<div class="body">
<p style="font-size: +1.1em;">
In release 9.0 we have updated the <i>D. melanogaster</i> genome to release 5.3 and the <i>A. gambiae</i> genome to release AgamP3.4.  We have added mRNA localisation data from Fly-FISH (<a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/krause/" target="_new">Krause lab</a>) and updated many other sources of data.
</p>

<h3>Genome Updates</h3>
<p>
The <i>D. melanogaster</i> genome has been updated to release 5.3 from FlyBase.  The <i>A. gambiae</i> genome has been updated to release AgamP3.4 from Ensembl.  Note that with this genome build the identifier scheme has changed - the primary identifiers for <i>A. gambiae</i> features now used in modMine are those from VectorBase.
</p>

<h3>Fly-FISH data</h3>
<p>
mRNA subcellular localisation data for <i>D. melanogaster</i> from Fly-FISH has been added.  There is a new widget on the gene list analysis page to display the numbers of genes in the list that are localised, not localised or not expressed. 
</p>

<h3>Other data changes</h3>
<p>
Many data sources have been updated to the latest available versions.  See the <a href="/dataCategories.do">data categories</a> page for more details.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>NEW - Four more <i>D. melanogaster</i> RNAi screens added from the DRSC.</li>
  <li>UPDATE - All 14 screens from the DRSC have a standardized results annotation, making it easier to query all of them simultaneously.</li>
  <li>FIX - first authors of publications are now set correctly.</li>
  <li>FIX - <i>D. melanogaster</i> Affymetrix probes no longer have genome locations - the locations were previously for an old genome assembly.</li>
  <li>FIX - <i>A. mellifera</i> genes and proteins are now linked together where possible, GO annotation is now attached to genes.</li>
  <li>FIX - evidence for proteins from UniProt is correctly set to Swiss-Prot ot TrEmbl.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>User interface changes</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>NEW - spaces can be used as separators again in the list upload page - gene names with spaces should be quoted - e.g. "even skipped".</li>
  <li>NEW - widgets and template sections are now collapsed in list analysis page to improve page navigation.</li>
  <li>FIX - list upload from a file now works on Safari.</li>
  <li>FIX - FASTA export for Translation sequence is now fixed.</li>
  <li>FIX - links to VectorBase now correctly access gene pages.</li>
  <li>FIX - annoying 'Found 1 match(es) message removed from results page.</li>
  <li>FIX - correct template name/description displayed when clicking on 'Show in table' in a report page.</li>
  <li>FIX - some classes weren't listed in the class chooser in the QueryBuilder tab, now fixed.</li>
  <li>FIX - text in template form dropdowns should now always be displayed correctly.</li>
  <li>FIX - fixed bug with setting ascending/descending sort order in QueryBuilder.</li>
</ul>

<div class="heading2">modMine version 8.2 - release notes (17th October 2007)</div>
<div class="body">
<p style="font-size: +1.1em;">
In release 8.2 we have added new ways to link to modMine, optional organism constraints to many templates and changed the publication widget on the list analysis page to show statistical enrichment.
</p>

<h3>Link to modMine</h3>
<p>
In response to requests from other sites you can now link directly to modMine list analysis pages with any list of identifiers.  List analysis pages show graphs, tables and statistical enrichment for properties of a list - e.g. gene expression, protein domains, publications and pathways.  You can also link into modMine with, for example, a protein identifier and request to see the corresponding gene report page.  See <a href="/link.shtml">this document</a> to find out how to create links.
</p>

<h3>Publication Enrichment</h3>
<p>
The publication widget on the gene list analysis page now shows statistical enrichment of related publications.  This is a great way to find the most relevent publications for a given gene list and may help you interpret the list.  Gene/publication relationships are loaded from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez" target="_new">PubMed</a>.
</p>

<h3>Optional organism constraints</h3>
<p>
Many templates now have an optional constraint on organism to make it easier to use these templates with gene symbols.
</p>

<h3>Other changes</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>FIX - template form layouts have been improved.</li>
  <li>FIX - totals are now displayed correctly in the FlyAtlas widget on list analysis pages.</li>
  <li>FIX - wildcards now work in quick search again (e.g. you can search for 'zen*').</li>
  <li>FIX - Lists/Templates pages are now correctly reset if text is removed from filter box.</li>
  <li>FIX - logging out on some pages gave an error message, this is fixed.</li>
</ul>
