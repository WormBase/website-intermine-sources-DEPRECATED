NAME
    Webservice::InterMine - modules for interacting with InterMine
    datawarehouse webservices

SYNOPSIS
        use Webservice::InterMine;

        my $service  = Webservice::InterMine->new_service($url);
        my $template = $service->template($name);
        my $results  = $template->results_with(valueA => 'x', valueB => 'y');

      OR

        use Webservice::InterMine 'www.flymine.org';

        my $query    = Webservice::InterMine->new_query;
        $query->add_view(@views);
        $query->add_constraint(
                        path  => $path,
                        op    => $op,
                        value => $value,
                        );
        my $results  = $query->results;

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution is the client interface to any implementation of the
    InterMine Datawarehousing WebService (www.intermine.org). Primarily used
    for biological genomic databases, the webservice allows the user to
    easily write and execute structured queries.

    This module allows you to interact with one or more webservices by
    providing a url to an InterMine implementation.

  Usage
    You can call "use Webservice::InterMine" without any parameters, which
    simply means you need to either specify the webservice url on every
    call, or call the methods on a service directly.

    If you call "use Webservice::InterMine $url", a default service will be
    set, meaning method calls will not require the webservice url. Unless
    you are intending to access multiple services, the latter form is
    recommended.

METHODS
  new_query( [$url] )
    returns a new query object for you to fill in with constraints before
    being run to get its results. If you pass a url, it constructs a query
    for the specified webservice.

    Please see Webservice::InterMine::Query

  template( $name, [$url] )
    returns the named template (if it exists - if not it returns undef). If
    you pass a url, it returns the named template from the specified
    webservice.

    Please see Webservice::InterMine::Query::Template

  saved_query( $name, [$url] ) NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
    returns the named saved_query (if it exists - if not it returns undef).
    If you pass a url, it returns the named query from the specified
    webservice.

    This method requires you to have provided a username and password to the
    webservice for authentication.

    Please see Webservice::InterMine::Query::Saved

  get_service( [$url, $user, $pass] )
    returns a webservice object, which is used to construct queries and
    fetch templates and saved queries. If a url is passed, the webservice
    for that url is returned, otherwise the service for the url given to
    "use" is returned.

    Please note: user and password based authentication has not yet been
    implemented.
