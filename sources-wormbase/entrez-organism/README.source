entrez-organism is a source that operates in two steps.  It first queries the
ObjectStore to find the NCBI taxonomy identifiers of all Organism objects.  It
then queries the NCBI taxonomy server to find the full species and genus of
the organism and then updates the Organism objects with that information.  All
InterMine sources use taxon ID to identify organism.
