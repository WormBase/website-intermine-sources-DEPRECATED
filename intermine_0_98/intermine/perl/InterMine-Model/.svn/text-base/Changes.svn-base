0.9401  Sun Sep 26 13:54:14 BST 2010
        Descriptors now have overloaded string representation: $_->name

0.9600  Tue Feb 22 18:07:12 GMT 2011
        * ClassDescriptors are now Moose::Meta::Classes too - 
        allowing direct instantiation of their objects.
        * The attributes of instantiated objects are type-safe
0.9601  Wed Feb 23 16:27:05 GMT 2011
        * Weaken is no longer necessary: it causes warnings.
        * Finally activated the boilerplate tests
0.9602  Fri Feb 25 21:00:08 GMT 2011
        * More documentation
        * ClassDescriptor->references no longer includes Collections
        * silenced JSON::Boolean coercion warning with horrible hack
        * Caching and merging of objects based on objectId - true object identity over graphs
        * Basic instantiation prototype now an actual class 
          rather than a bundle of methods (InterMine::Model::Object).
        * Reimplemented some attributes as methods to save memory
        * Weakened some circular references to prevent leaks
0.9603  Mon Feb 28 18:56:16 GMT 2011
        * Made as much as possible immutable.
        * Fixed bug with prevented instantiation of more than one model at a time.
0.9604  Tue Mar  1 11:53:46 GMT 2011
        * Declared incompatibility with Test::More's 2.0 devel series, until 
          subtests are deemed safe again
0.9605  Tue Mar  1 15:12:25 GMT 2011
        * Misunderstanding about how POD is parsed fixed by putting 
          the Model::Handler in its own separate file.
        * Model can now handle more source formats
        * Supplies a TestModel instance to other consuming packages for testing against
0.9606  Thu Mar  3 02:14:48 GMT 2011
        * Models (and their descriptors) can serialise themselves back into xml
        * Added ByIndex to collection get handler to avoid cases where a class has both
          "foo" and "foos". 
0.9607  Thu Mar  3 18:17:20 GMT 2011
        * Provided POD for constants, as some versions of Pod::Coverage demand it
0.9700  This package is now responsible for all its own type definitions.
0.9701  Bug fix
0.9702  Declared required version of MooseX::Role::WithOverloading
0.9801  Finally got boolean fields to get readers prefixed with 'is'. Also, unprefixed accessors for convenience.

0.9803  Accept underscores in path names.
