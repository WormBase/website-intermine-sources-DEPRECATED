= Biological Extensions to the InterMine Webservice Client Library 

This library is a set of extensions to the InterMine Webservices client, 
providing access for data in biological formats. It directly extends the 
InterMine classes, providing extra methods to the Query class.

== Example

Get all sequences for proteins on "h", "r", "eve", "bib" and "zen":

    require "rubygems"
    require "intermine/service"
    require "intermine/bio"

    s = Service.new("www.flymine.org/query")
    syms = %w{h r eve bib zen} 

    puts s.query(:Gene).select(:proteins).where(:symbol => syms).fasta

Process the locations of these genes one at a time:

    s.query.select(:Gene).where(:symbol => syms).bed do |line|
      process line
    end

== Who is this for?

InterMine data warehouses are typically constructed to hold
Biological data, and as this library facilitates programmatic
access to these data, this install is primarily aimed at 
bioinformaticians. In particular, users of the following services
may find it especially useful:
 * FlyMine (http://www.flymine.org/query)
 * YeastMine (http://yeastmine.yeastgenome.org/yeastmine)
 * RatMine (http://ratmine.mcw.edu/ratmine)
 * modMine (http://intermine.modencode.org/release-23)
 * metabolicMine (http://www.metabolicmine.org/beta)

These extensions are aimed at bioinformaticians looking to integrate
these sources of data into other workflows.

For details on constructing queries, see the intermine documentation.
