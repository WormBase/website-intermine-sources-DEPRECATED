    # A Representation of Connection to an InterMine Webservice
    # 
    # == Synopsis
    #
    #   require "intermine/service"
    #   service = Service.new("www.flymine.org/query")
    #
    #   query = service.query("Gene")
    #   list = service.list("My-Favourite-List")
    #   template = service.template("Probe_Gene")
    #   model = service.model
    #
    # == Description
    #
    # The service object is the gateway to all InterMine webservice
    # functionality, and the mechanism by which resources such as 
    # queries, lists, templates and models can be obtained. In itself, it
    # doen't do much, but it facilitates all the operations that can be achieved 
    # with the InterMine API.
    #
    # == Using Queries
    #
    #   service.query("Gene").
    #           select("*", "proteins.proteinDomains.*").
    #           where(:symbol => %{h bib r eve zen}).
    #           order_by(:molecularWeight).
    #           each_result do |gene|
    #             handle_result(gene)
    #           end
    #
    # Queries are arbitrarily complex requests for data over the whole resources
    # of the data-warehouse, similar in scope and design to the SQL queries that
    # they are eventually run as in the webservice. The PathQuery::Query object
    # can be obtained directly from the service with the Service#query constructor.
    # See PathQuery::Query for more details.
    #
    # == Using Templates
    #
    #   service.template("Probe_Genes").each_row(:A => "probeid") do |row|
    #     puts row["gene.primaryIdentifier"]
    #   end
    #
    # Templates are a simpler way of running queries, as they are mostly 
    # predefined, and simply require a parameter or two to be changed to get 
    # different results. They are an effective way of saving and repeating workflows, 
    # and can be precomputed to improve response times for queries you run frequently.
    #
    # See PathQuery::Template
    #
    # == Using Lists
    #
    #   new_list = service.create_list("my/gene_list.txt", "Gene", ["experimentA", "projectB"])
    #   existing_list = service.list("Genes I'm interested in")
    #   intersection = new_list & existing_list
    #   intersection.name = "My genes from experimentA"
    #
    # Lists are saved result-sets and user curated collections of objects 
    # of a particular type. You may have a list of Genes you are particularly
    # interested in, or Pathways that concern your research. Using lists simplifies
    # queries against large groups of objects at once, and allows for 
    # more streamlined analysis. Unlike queries and (to a degree) Templates, 
    # Lists are not just about reading in information - they can be created, renamed, 
    # modified, deleted. You can manage your lists effectively and quickly using the API.
    #
    # == Inspecting the model
    #
    #   model = service.model
    #   puts "Classes in the model:"
    #   model.classes.each do |c|
    #     puts c.name
    #   end
    #
    # The data model, which defines what queries are possible in the data-warehouse, 
    # is fully introspectible and queriable. This allows for sophisticated meta-programming
    # and dynamic query generation. 
    #
