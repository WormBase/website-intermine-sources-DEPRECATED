<p>This package contains the files for reading and writing Intermine project and
model files.
</p>

<p>The model viewer uses JAXB for transforming XML documents into Java objects.
Unfortunately, the project and model files typically distributed by Intermine
have no schema attached to them. JAXB really doesn't like this, so for maximum
tolerance SAX {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler}s are used to read these files.
Files written out by this code will be fully formed and correct.
</p>

<p>At present, models are read only. Disassembling them to write a given
additions file may not be a trivial process.
