<p>The classes in this package are modified versions of sources copied from JDK 1.6.</p>
<p>They allow the clients to run on Java 5 while having minimal modifications from the
proper Java 6 code. All classes are flagged as deprecated, as they are already
superceded by their Java 6 proper versions.</p>
