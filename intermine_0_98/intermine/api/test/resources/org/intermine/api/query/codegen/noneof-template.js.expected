<!-- This is an automatically generated code snippet to run your query
 using the intermine JavaScript client library. It is assumed that you
 will be wanting to run this query from a webpage, and so the code is
 formatted such that you can just cut and paste it into any webpage -->

<!-- You need to import the IMBedding client library - this is hosted at intermine.org for your convenience: -->
<script src="http://www.intermine.org/lib/imbedding/0.2/imbedding.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

<!-- We also need to import a stylesheet - you can choose from light, dark or bold-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" title="light" href="http://intermine.org/lib/imbedding/0.2/style/light.css">

<!-- You need to set a place holder element in your page to hold the resultant table - this can also hold apology text/content -->
<div id="queryplaceholder"><p class="apology">Please be patient while the results of your query are retrieved.</p></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
