<h1 id="start">1. What is metabolicMine?</h1>


<p>metabolicMine is a data warehouse that integrates diverse biological data sets and 
the tools to explore them. The main focus of metabolicMine is genomics and proteomics of 
common metabolic diseases. By integrating such data into one place it is possible to 
construct queries across domains of biological knowledge.</p>

<p> See a List of all the data sources from the toolbar on any metabolicMine page:</p>
<img alt="[Quick Search]" src="mmToolbar_Data_2.png"/>


<p>The metabolicMine user interface is designed to go beyond simply looking
up an identifier and viewing a report page.  This quick tour will
introduce some of the features:</p>

<p>The first thing you'll see is the <strong>First Time Here</strong> box. 

<img alt="[First Time Here]" src="mmFTHbox.png"/></p>

<p>Here's where you'll find our handy <strong>Feature Hints</strong>. Scroll through when you 
need a quick reminder of the different parts of metabolicMine and what everything does.
Don't worry - you can minimize the box when you're done with it.</p>

<p>Moving down the page we encounter three colour-coded boxes showing the main ways of 
interacting with the database. On the left (in orange) we have the Search box, in the middle 
(in green) the Lists and on the right (in purple) our predefined Templates.</p>

<img alt="[Function Boxes]" src="mmFunctionBoxes.png"/>

<p><strong>Search</strong> is available, just like on other sites, simply type in
an identifier to see a report page. You can search with identifiers 
(Gene symbols, accession codes, PubMed IDs etc.) or keywords (eg. Diabetes) and Authors (eg. Sanger F). 
Additionally, you can use Boolean (AND, OR, NOT) and wildcards (*) to refine your results.</p>

<p><u>Filtering with Facets</u>
<br>Our search engine operates across all data fields giving you the highest chance 
of getting a result. <strong>Facets</strong> show you the different places where your 
search words were found (eg. Gene, Protein, Go Term, Template). You can use the facets 
to filter for the type of results that are most important to you. When you filter by facet you
can even save a List straight from your results. There's more about Lists later.</p>

<p><img alt="[Facets]" src="mmLuceneFacets_diabet.png"/></p>

<p>The <strong>Lists</strong> area lets you operate on whole sets of data at once.  You can
upload your own Lists (favourite Genes, SNPs etc) or save them from results tables.  
We also create useful <strong>Public Lists</strong> for everyone to use. You can start to explore 
your data on the List Analysis Page. 
Here are just some of the things you can do:<UL>
<LI>Ask questions about the data using our predefined Templates</LI>
<LI>Combine or subtract the content of other Lists</LI>
<LI>Uncover hidden relationships with our analysis <strong>Widgets</strong></LI>
</UL>

<img alt="[Lists]" src="mmToolbar_Lists_2.png"/>

<br>You're automatically taken to the List Analysis Page when you first create a List 
or when you visit a List that you've stored previously.</p>

<p><strong>Template queries</strong> are 'predefined' queries that are designed around specific tasks. 
Templates provide you with a simple form that lets you define your starting point and optional 
filters to help focus your search.

Our Templates are designed around the common tasks performed by our Biologist Community. 
They cover common questions like:<UL>
<LI>I have a List of SNPs - do any of them affect Genes?</LI>
<LI>This Gene came up in my results - what can I find out about it?</LI>
<LI>I'm interested in this chromosome region - what's in there that could be linked with this disease?</LI>
</UL>

<br>You can create your own Templates after you create a <strong>MyMine</strong> account and log in. 
You can modify our pre-existing Templates or start from scratch with the QueryBuilder.
Alternatively, the metabolicMine Team are search speciaLists so we can quickly build Custom 
Templates for you.</p>

<p>The Powerhouse of metabolicMine, <strong>QueryBuilder (QB)</strong> allows you to construct your own 
custom queries, modify your previous queries and Edit Templates. The easiest way to get started 
with QB is by editing one of our pre-existing Template queries. Follow the simple tutorial in the 
QueryBuilder section to change a Template output or add a filter.</p>

<p><strong>MyMine</strong> is your <u>personal space</u> on metabolicMine. Creating an account allows you 
to save your Queries, Lists and Templates you've modified for later use. You can also mark the 
most useful Public Templates as favourites so they're easier to find.</p>

<p> All these features are accessible from the Tab toolbar on every matabolicMine page:</p>

<img alt="[Tab Shortcuts]" src="mmToolbar_home.png"/>


<h1>2. Report Page</h1>

<p>A quick search box appears in the menu bar of all pages.  You can search for any identifier 
or symbol for Genes, Proteins, transcripts and so on.  You can use '*' as a wildcard.</p>

<p><strong>Run a quick search for the Human Gene <i>PPARG</i>:</strong></p>

<img alt="[Quick Search]" src="mmQuickSearch_PPARG.png"/>

<p>
The report page shows information from many data sources in one place.  There are corresponding 
pages for all objects in metabolicMine, use <img alt="[details...]" valign="bottom" src="details.png"/> links to browse.
</p>

<img alt="[Report Page Summary]"  src="mmReportPagePPARG_2.png"/>

<p>
Our stored Template queries are run for this Gene when the page is loaded giving you an 
indication of the number of results returned by the query.
</p>

<img alt="[object details Templates]"  src="mmReportPageBotPPARG_2.png"/>


<h1>3. Template Queries</h1>

<p>MetabolicMine includes a library of <strong>Template queries</strong> - predefined queries designed 
to perform a particular task.  Each one has a description and a form to fill in.  For example, 
there are Templates to find GO annotation for a Gene, to retrieve Protein-Protein interactions 
or even predict the consequences for a set of SNPs.</p>

<p>You can find all metabolicMine Templates on the Templates page, accessible via the toolbar on 
any page. Here you can search the titles and descriptions of all Templates.</p>

<p><i>We can add Templates to this page at any time - it only takes a few minutes - so if you have 
a suggestion, let us know!</i></p>

<img alt="[Templates Tab]"  src="mmToolbar_Templates_2.png"/>

<p><strong> On the Templates page, search Templates for 'Gene':</strong></p>


<img alt="[Search Gene Templates]"  src="mmTemplateSearch_Gene.png"/>


<p><strong>and select the Template 'Gene ---> GO terms':</strong></p>

<img alt="[Select Gene --> GO Template]"  src="mmGeneGOtemplate_2.png"/>


<h1>4. Run a Template</h1>

<p>The Template we found in our previous search takes a particular Gene as input and returns 
the GeneOntology (GO) annotation(s) of the Gene. We clicked on the title of the Template to show 
the Template form. </p>

<p>
<img alt="[Select Gene --> GO Template]"  src="mmGeneGOtemplate_2.png"/>
</p>

<p>Now you can run the Template with the default value or restrict it to the Gene of your 
choice. You can enter any identifier and metabolicMine will try to find the right Gene.  For 
example, for the <i>H. sapiens</i> Gene <i>PPARG</i> you can enter 'PPARG', 'PPARgamma', 
'ENSG00000132170', 'GLM1' or any synonym.  You can even enter a transcript (ENST00000397010) 
or Protein (PPARG_HUMAN) identifier and metabolicMine will convert it for you.</p>

<p><strong>Click 'Show Results' to run this Template with the default value:</strong></p>

<p>
<img alt="[Template form]"  src="mmGeneGOtemplForm_3.png"/>
</p>

<h1>5. Results Page</h1>

<p>
The results table for the Template 'Gene --> GO terms' shows the starting Gene (primary 
identifier and symbol) with details of each GO term applied to the Gene.
</p>

<img alt="[Results table]"  src="mmGeneGOresTable_2.png"/>

<p>
Summary buttons <img alt="[icon]"  src="summary_maths.png" valign="center"/> at the top of 
each column allow you to view some summary statistics.  For names and identifiers it will 
tell you about unique values, numerical data gives the min, max, mean and standard deviation.
</p>

<p><strong>Click the summary button for the column 'GO annotation > ontologyTerm > name'</strong></p>

<p>
The table shows the most commonly occurring GO terms applied to the Gene:
</p>

<img alt="[Summary table]"  src="mmGOnameColSum.png"/>

<p>
All results pages have a number of export options:
</p>

<img alt="[Export]"  src="mmGeneGOexport.png"/>


<h1>6. Creating a List</h1>

<p>metabolicMine can operate on custom Lists of data.  You can save Lists from results 
pages or create them by uploading your own Lists of identifiers.  Lists can be used when 
running Template queries and can be analysed using a series of <strong>widgets</strong> on the List Analysis page.  
You can merge, subtract and find common members if you have more than one List.</p>


<p>
metabolicMine includes a set of 'Public' Lists (marked with 'PL') that we think might be 
useful for our users. These originate from external datasources (including journal articles 
and external databases) or have been contributes by our Biologist community. Let us know if you find 
any <i>must-have</i> Lists</p>

<p><FONT COLOR="FF6600"><i>We can add more Lists at any time - it only takes a few minutes - so if you have a 
suggestion, let us know!</i></FONT></p>
</p>

<p>All Lists (public ones as well as personal ones - if you are logged in) can be viewed on 
the Lists page, where you can search them and do operations on them. </p>

<img alt="[Lists Tab]"  src="mmToolbar_ListView_2.png"/>

<p>
<strong>To create a new List yourself, click on 'Lists', and then on 'Upload' in the toolbar 
on any metabolicMine page:</strong>
</p>

<img alt="[Lists Upload]"  src="mmToolbar_ListUpload_2.png"/>

<p>
metabolicMine's List creation tool helps you upload a List of identifiers, the List can 
even contain a mix of identifier types.</p>

<p><strong>Now upload the example List:</strong></p>

<img alt="[Create a new List]"  src="mmCreateListExampl_2.png"/>


<h1>7. List Confirmation</h1>

<p>
If some identifiers don't produce an exact match a confirmation page lets you resolve 
any issues.  In our example, two Genes were found through a synonym and three have been 
converted to their corresponding Gene through their Transcript or Protein primary accession numbers. 
You can check through each issue or just add all the matches to your List.
</p>

<p><strong>Click 'Add all' to include all suggested Genes to the List:</strong></p>

<img alt="[List ID resolver]"  src="mmListConvers_2.png"/>

<p><strong>Choose a name for your List and save it - we'll use 'myGeneList' for this exercise:</strong></p>

<img alt="[Save List]"  src="mmSaveList_2.png"/>


<h1>8. List Analysis Page</h1>

<p>
The List analysis page is a great way to find out more about a List of Genes.  A number 
of 'widgets' display graphs and tables to summarise the contents.  These are 
interactive - click to see Lists of Genes in each category.
</p>

<p><FONT COLOR="FF6600"><i>We plan to continually add more widgets and functionality to the List analysis page 
so if you have suggestions on what you'd like to see, please let us know.</i></FONT></p>


<p>The GO enrichment and Pathway widgets suggest that members of this List of Genes may be involved in lipid storage.</p>

<img alt="[List widgets]"  src="mmGOpathLipWidget_2.png"/>

<p>
Template queries have been executed on the whole List, just like on the Gene report page.  
This is a simple way to retrieve further information about the entire List.  For example, 
you could retrieve a list of Orthologues or Protein Domains.
</p>

<h1>9. Use Lists in Templates</h1>

<p>
You can use Lists in any Template query, or in queries you create yourself in the QueryBuilder.  
As the List analysis page suggested, some of the Genes in our List are involved in lipid 
pathways so it might be interesting to see if any of them are linked to a Disease. metabolicMine
includes human Disease / Gene relationships from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim" target="_new">OMIM</a>. 
OMIM is a curated database of human Genes and Genetic disorders which we can query with 
one of our predefined Templates. 
</p>

<p><strong>Click on the Templates Tab (located on the top menu bar) and search the Template queries for 'disease'. 
Now select the Template </strong></p>
<p><strong>'Gene --> Disease (OMIM)':</strong></p>

<img alt="[Select Template]"  src="mmTemplateSearch_Dis_2.png"/>

<p>Now that we have created a List the Template query gives us the option to use it 
instead of entering an identifier.</p>

<p><strong>Click the checkbox to select the List you named earlier, and then run the query.</strong></p>

<img alt="[Run Template with List]"  src="mmDiseaseTemplList_2.png"/>

<p>The results table shows the Genes from our original List that have associations with 
Diseases (according to the OMIM database). Using the Column Summary button on the 'Gene > Symbol' we 
can see that 10 of our Genes have Disease associations (Total unique values: 10).</p>

<p>You can also create new Lists from results tables.  We can save the List Disease Genes 
from this query to view in the List analysis page or to use in more Templates.</p>

<p><strong>Click on the checkbox by 'Gene > primaryIdentifier' to select all of the entries. 
Now click on the 'Create List' button (just above primaryIdentifier column) and choose a 
name for the saved List.</strong>

If you wanted to select a subset you can click on the individual entries. Alternatively, 
holding the SHIFT key and clicking will allow you to select a range of entries.</p>

<img alt="[Save column in a List]"  src="mmResultsPage_2.png"/>
<br/>

<p>Using Lists is an excellent way to retrieve information about collections of data. 
For example we could also retrieve:
<ul>
<li>all the orthologues in another organism, e.g. <i>M. musculus</i></li>
<li>all associated SNPs</li>
<li>Protein-Protein interactions for these Genes</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>10. Query Builder</h1>

<p>The QueryBuilder allows you to edit queries or create new ones.  It is aimed at advanced 
users but editing a Template query to change the output or add a filter is easy.</p>

<p><strong>Now use the browser back button to return to the results table.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Click on 'Query' in the Trail to get back to the Template form:</strong></p>

<img alt="[Click on trail]"  src="mmQueryBreadcrumb_2.png"/>

<p><strong>Now click 'Edit Query' to bring up the QueryBuilder:</strong></p>

<p><img alt="[Click edit query]"  src="mmEditDiseaseTempl_2.png"/></p>


<p>The pane on the left is a view of the data model starting at the Gene class and showing 
all attributes (e.g. name, symbol) and related classes (e.g. organism, Proteins).  
metabolicMine uses an object based data model - biological types are termed 'classes' and 
individual entries are termed 'objects'.  For example the <i>PPARG</i> and <i>TCF7L2</i> 
Genes are both objects of the class Gene.</p>

<p>You can click <img alt="[plus]" src="plus.gif"/> to open related classes and see their 
attributes.  Use the <img alt="[show]"  src="show.gif"/> button to add fields to the output.  
The <img alt="[constrain]" src="constrain.gif"/> buttons let you refine your search (aka: add constraints or filters). </p> 

<img alt="[query builder]"  src="query_builder.png"/>

<p>The query summary section shows the constraints applied to this query.  Notice that one of 
them says 'IN myGeneList'.  This shows us that the search is using only the Genes from the List (myGeneList)
that we saved earlier.</p> 

<p>What if we want to search for <strong>all</strong> Genes in metabolicMine for <strong>Diabetes</strong> Genes?  
We can just remove the Genes constraint, add a constraint for Disease and run the query again.</p> 

<p><strong>Click on the <img alt="[red cross]"  src="cross.gif"/> button next to 'IN myGeneList'' 
to remove the constraint:</strong></p>

<img alt="[remove constraint]"  src="mmRemoveListConstraint_2.png"/>

<p><strong>Now, click on the Disease link in the 'Query Overview' panel': </strong></p>
<p>Hint: you can find it in the middle of 'diseases Disease collection'.</p> 

<p><img alt="[Add constraint]"  src="mmAddDisConstraint_2.png"/></p>

<p>As you hover over it you'll see a Tooltip with 'Show Disease in model browser'.</p>

<p><strong>Scroll to the diseases model and find 'name' (It should have a box around it to show 
that it appears in our query). To the right of 'name' click constrain:</strong></p>

<img alt="[Constrain Disease Model]"  src="mmDisModelConstraint_2.png"/>

<p><strong>Type *diabetes* in the filter box and Click 'Add to query''</strong></p>

<img alt="[Constrain Box]"  src="mmDisConstraintBox_2.png"/>

<p><strong>Now scroll down the page and click 'Show results' to run the query:</strong></p>

<img alt="[click show results]"  src="mmClickShowRes_2.png"/>

<p>The results table now shows all the Genes in metabolicMine for which there are known Disease 
associations, the name of the Disease and its OMIM identifier.  You can use the summary buttons 
<img alt="[summary icon]"  src="summary_maths.png" valign="middle"/> on 'Gene > diseases > name' to 
find more information about the numbers of Genes associated with each Disease.</p>



<h1>11. MyMine</h1>

<p> All Lists and queries you ran will be saved temporarily in metabolicMine for the current session. 
To save them permanently, you can create a <strong>MyMine account</strong>. You only need to provide an email 
address and a password to Generate an account, there is no other information required.  Your saved data 
is always private.</p>

<img alt="[Click log in]"  src="mmToolbar_logIn_2.png"/>

<p> You can then access all your Lists, Queries and Templates via the MyMine page. In MyMine you can save 
Lists and Queries you create in the QueryBuilder.  You can also use QueryBuilder to turn queries into 
new Templates of your own.  You can even export/import Queries and Templates as XML to share them with others. </p>

<img alt="[myMine Tab]"  src="mmToolbar_myMine_2.png"/>

 
<p>The <img alt="[Favourite]"  src="star_active.gif"/> icon lets you set Templates as favourites so 
it's easy to access the ones you use often.</p>
