<h1 id="start">Tutorial 1: Creating and using Lists</h1>

    <p><i>This tutorial will illustrate how to create lists and how to
    make use of lists. As an example, we will search for the
    orthologues of D. melanogaster eye specification genes in
    D. pseudoobscura. We will then export the gene sequences the
    D. melanogaster genes and their D. pseudoobscura orthologues all
    at once.</i></p>


      <p>All queries in modMine can be performed on lists of objects
    that you create yourself. Saved lists of data can be used to
    constrain queries (either in a template query or in the
    QueryBuilder), perform logical operations (union, intersect,
    subtract) and can be exported. A list can be created from a result
    page or from an external source. </p>

    <p> The <b> Lists page</b> can be accessed from the modMine home
    page or via the tabs in the top menu bar available on any modMine
    page. Lists that you have created yourself can also be accessed
    through your <b>MyMine</b> page.



<h1>1. Creating a list from an external source</h1>


      <p><i>To find the orthologues of the D. melanogaster genes in
      D. pseudoobscura, we will first make a list of the
      D. melanogaster genes.</i></p>

      <p>Click on <b>Lists</b> in the top menu bar, and then on the
      list <b>Upload</b> tab to create a list from an external
      source.</p>

      <p>
      <img alt="[toolbar_upload.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="toolbar_upload.png"/>
      </p>

    <ol>
        <li><p>Since it is currently not possible to create a
      list of mixed objects (eg proteins and genes), you have to
      specify your <b>type of list</b>. In this example, we will make a list
      of type 'Gene'. It is possible, however, to have a mix of the
      type of identifier (eg for a list of <i>Drosophila</i> genes your list
      may contain both gene symbols, CG identifiers and
      FBgns).</p></li>

        <li><p>Optionally you can also <b>set the organism</b> for
      your list of identifiers - this is useful if you have, for
      example, gene symbols in your list which may appear in more than
      one organism. In this example, select <i>Drosophila
      melanogaster</i>.</p></li>

        <li><p>Now you can either type or cut and paste in a
      list of identifiers, or upload a list from a file. Separate
      identifiers by a comma, space, tab or new line.  Qualify any
      identifiers that contain whitespace with double quotes like so:
      "even skipped". As an example, type in the following 10 gene
      symbols in the box: argos, PAX6_DROME, CG9554, fbgn0011647, lz,
      toy, dac, toe, "sine oculis", Dsix3 and click on 'Create
      list'. Before creating your list, all your identifiers will be
      compared against the modMine database and any discrepancies will
      be reported to you on the 'list confirmation
      page'.</p></li>
    </ol>

      <p>
      <img alt="[list_upload.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="list_upload.png"/></p>

<h1>2. List confirmation page</h1>

      <p><i>The example list check matches 7 genes successfully but contains 3
      discrepancies - two low quality matches and a converted type:</i></p>

    <ol>
        <li><p><b>Low quality matches</b>: A low quality match is
      one that does not match the main identifiers in the database but
      which was found by searching the synonyms. In this case Dsix3
      and FBgn0011647 are old (or secondary) identifiers. However, it
      has found the genes that we want so we can add both to our list
      by clicking on 'add' in the last column.</p></li>

        <li><p><b>Converting types</b>: When we uploaded our list we
      specified that we wanted to make a list of genes. However one
      item in our list is actually a protein identifier
      (PAX6_DROME). modMine has found this protein in the database
      along with the gene that encodes it. It is not possible to make
      a list of mixed 'types' but we can now add the gene for this
      protein to our list.</p></li>

        <li><p><b>Duplicate genes</b>: You may also see
      discrepancies called 'Duplicate genes'. This can occur if, for
      example, you have gene symbols in your list and the symbol is
      found in more than one organism. Such discrepancies can be
      avoided by using the optional organism constraint on the list
      upload page. It will also happen when two gene symbols differ in
      case, since modMine is not case-sensitive.</p></li>
    </ol>


      <p>In any of these case, all occurrences of the gene
      will be listed and you can select the one you intended to be in
      your list. Once you are happy with your list you can <b>give it a
      name</b>, eg. eye_genes_dmel, and press <b>Save list</b>.</p>

<h1>3. List analysis page</h1>

      <p>Details of the contents of a list together with additional
     information about a list can be viewed through the 'List
     Analysis' page. The analysis page for a list is automatically
     displayed when a list is created. List analysis pages can be
     accessed at other times by clicking on the list name on the 'list
     page'.</p>

      <p>All list analysis pages have the same structure and consist of three sections:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><p><b>A summary of the contents of the list</b></p>

      <p>
            <img alt="[listpage_top.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="listpage_top.png"/></p>
          
      </li>

        <li><p> <b>A series of widgets</b> giving more information on
      the list, for example, for a list of genes, a graph of the
      chromosome distribution, a statistical analysis of the GO term
      distribution (GO term enrichment), KEGG pathway data, protein
      domain enrichment and publication enrichment.</p>

      <p>
         <img alt="[listpage_widget.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="listpage_widget.png" /></p>
    
          
     </li>

        <li><p><b>A set of template queries</b> that have been pre-run
      on the set of objects in the list.<p></li>

      <img alt="[listpage_templates.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="listpage_templates.png"/></p>

   </ol>

<h1>4. Using a list in a template query</h1>

      <p><i>Now we want to find all the orthologous genes in
    D. pseudoobscura.</i></p>

    <p>We can do this using an existing template for that: <b>'Gene
    --&gt; Orthologues in one specific organism'</b>. The template can
    be found in two different ways:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><p>Select the Comparative Genomics data category from the
      modMine homepage and find the template 'Gene --&gt; Orthologues in
      one specific organism'.</p></li>

        <li><p>Alternatively, go to the Templates page and find
      the right template using the search box, as shown below:</p></li>
      </ol>

      <p>
      <img alt="[template_filter.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="template_filter.png"/></p>

      <p>In both cases, the template can be opened by clicking on the template title.</p>

      <p>Any variable in a template query can be constrained
    to a list (or 'not in' a list) rather than a single value. Click
    on the check-box below the Gene box to constrain the template to
    all genes in a list. The name of the list you just created will
    appear in the drop-down menu. Select the right organisms from the
    two other drop-down menus and run the query.</p>

      <p>
      <img alt="[list-template.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="templateform.png"/></p>


<h1>5. Creating a list from a result table</h1>

      <p><i>The results table from the previous template query shows the
      D. melanogaster genes with their corresponding
      orthologues in D. pseudoobscura. Only 7 out of the 10
      D. melanogaster genes have orthologues in
      D. pseudoobscura.</i></p>


      <p>Save the orthologous genes in a new list:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Click on the check-box in the title of column 4
      which contains the gene symbols for the orthologues. This
      selects all items in that column (on every result page, if more
      than one page) plus in three additional columns which refer to
      the same object. This is because you are saving the actual item
      (eg the gene) to a list, not just the
      identifier.</p></li>

      <li><p>At the bottom of the page is an option to save
      the selected results in a new list. Choose a new list name
      eg. 'eye_genes_dpse' and click 'Save'.</p></li>
   </ul>

      <img alt="[list-template-results.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="template_results.png"/>



<h1>6. Operation on lists</h1>

      <p><i>Now we want to download the sequences of both the
      D. melanogaster genes and the D. pseudoobscura genes all at
      once. The quickest way to achieve this is to fuse the two lists
      and download all sequences of the new fused list.</i> </p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>Go to the Lists-View page. Select the two lists
      (eyes_genes_dmel and eyes_genes_dpse), type in a new name for
      the new combined list and click on 'Union'. A message will
      appear saying that a new list was created, and the list itself
      will be listed on top.</p></li>

            <img alt="[list-union.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="lists_union.png"/>

        <li><p>Clicking on the new list name will display the
      list analysis page for this list. </p></li>

        <li><p>Click on 'View all 17 records' to display it as
      a result page. At the bottom of the result page is a link called
      'Export first visible column in FASTA format'. This will
      download the sequences of all the 17 genes in your
      list.</p></li>
    </ul>

<h1>7. Saving lists and queries</h1>

      <p>Lists of data, as well as previously executed queries, can be
    retrieved from your <b>MyMine</b> page at the top menu bar on any modMine
    page (lists can also be directly accessed on the 'Lists-view'
    page). Your lists and query history will remain available to you
    only for the duration of a session unless you create and use a
    <b>login</b>. If you log in (via button on top menu bar), your lists and
    query history can be stored permanently.</p>

      <p>Find your lists back in 'Lists':</p>
