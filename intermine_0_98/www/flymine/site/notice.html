Dear FlyMine users,
</p><br/>
<p>
We regret to announce that <a href="http://www.flymine.org">FlyMine</a> will only be updated
until December 2008/ January 2009.  After that the final version will
be kept live for as many years as it is still significantly used.
Condolences would be appreciated and can be sent to
<a href="mailto:support@flymine.org">support@flymine.org</a>!
</p><br/>
<p>
There are a couple of reasons for this change.  Currently there is a
great opportunity to develop a medically-focussed database using the
InterMine system developed during the FlyMine project: we plan to
generate a resource valuable to the broader biomedical research
community and for which there will be little overlap with other
resources worldwide.  In addition, our most recent funding reviewers
expressed concern at perceived overlap with FlyBase, leading us to
re-evaluate where we could most effectively contribute.
</p><br/>
<p>
Fortunately, FlyBase is keen to cover the loss of functionality
provided to the Drosophila community either by adopting InterMine or
by developing similar functionality themselves.  In order to assess
priorities for users we will be carrying out a survey jointly with
FlyBase and encourage you to take part.
</p><br/>
<p>
Drosophila data will still be available through the InterMine platform
as part of the <a href="http://www.modencode.org">modENCODE project</a>.  In
addition, the NIH is reviewing an application to incorporate InterMine
functionality as part of the yeast  (<a href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/">SGD</a>), rat (<a href="http://rgd.mcw.edu/">RGD</a>) and zebrafish
(<a href="http://zfin.org/">ZFIN</a>) model organism databases.
</p><br/>
<p>
During the FlyMine project our group developed the open source
<a href="http://www.intermine.org">InterMine system</a>, which is software used to
create data warehouses with a flexible web interface.  InterMine
reduces the effort needed to build and maintain both small and
large-scale data warehouses, while providing flexible querying,
powerful operations on lists and integrated analysis tools.
</p><br/>
<p>
InterMine has become a successful project in its own right and is
being adopted by a growing number of groups for their own database
projects.  It has made real progress in enabling the creation of
integrated databases and providing biologists with advanced
functionality, and we will continue its development.  We thank all
users of FlyMine for contributing to this success by providing
feedback and suggestions.
